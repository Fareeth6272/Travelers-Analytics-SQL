# Key Insights & Analysis:
# 1) Cost & Expense Analysis:
* Identified destinations with above-average accommodation costs.
* Calculated total transportation expenses for each traveler.
* Extracted the top 5 most expensive trips based on combined accommodation and transportation costs.
# 2) Subqueries for Advanced Filtering:
* Compared individual accommodation costs to the average for specific trips.
* Analyzed destinations with the highest trip frequency and the most popular destinations based on traveler counts.
# 3) Joins to Explore Data Relationships:
* Used INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER JOINS to link travelers with trips, ensuring a comprehensive view of the dataset.
* Identified travelers from specific nationalities visiting a particular destination (e.g., London, UK).
# 4) Window Functions for Rankings and Trends:
* Ranked destinations by transportation costs using RANK() and DENSE_RANK().
* Analyzed trip duration trends using LAG() and LEAD() to compare durations between trips.
# 5) CTE (Common Table Expressions) for Complex Queries:
* Filtered trips lasting more than 7 days in 2027.
* Isolated trips with a total cost exceeding $2000 to highlight high-value trips.
# 6) Technologies & Skills:
* SQL: Proficient use of aggregate functions, subqueries, joins, and window functions.
* Data Analysis: Ability to derive actionable insights from large datasets.
* Optimization: Efficient query writing with CTEs for better performance on complex datasets.
# Recommendations
I suggest looking at how effective marketing campaigns are in bringing in revenue. By understanding when people travel most (like holidays or peak seasons), businesses can adjust prices and plan better. Also, checking how much each part of a trip costs (like accommodation and transportation) will help find ways to save money, without affecting the travelerâ€™s experience. This way, businesses can make more profit while keeping customers happy.
